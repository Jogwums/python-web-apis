# Python Web API Workshop Materials

This repository contains example code to use in learning to work with RESTful
web APIs in Python. This branch uses the Harvard Art Museums API; for the original botanical gardens dataset, please see release v1.0.0.

You can download the repository either with
`git clone https://github.com/artshumrc/python-web-apis.git` from the terminal,
or by clicking the green button towards the top right that says "Clone or
download" and clicking "Download ZIP".

The code uses Python 3.6 with the `requests` and `pandas` modules. We recommend the Anaconda distribution of Python, which comes with everything that we’ll use for the workshop. Be sure to get the Python 3.6 version. It’s a rather large download, so be sure to install it before you get to the workshop.
 
We’ll be using a Jupyter notebook for the interactive portion of the workshop, so be sure that you can launch Jupyter Notebook on your computer. It’s available through Anaconda Navigator, which is bundled with Anaconda, as well as through the terminal with `jupyter notebook`. If you can launch Jupyter Notebooks locally and navigate through the folders you’ll see when it launches, you’ll be ready to go.
