The arts flourished in many centers, and wealthy merchant and professional classes emerged. A dramatic increase in productivity and innovation and an unprecedented expansion of figural decoration characterize the arts of this period.
A transforming event was the influx of Turkic and Mongol peoples from Central and Inner Asia. Most of the objects in this case were created in lands ruled by the most important of the Turkic dynasties, the Great Seljuks (1038–1157), and their immediate successors, the Atabegs. The Mongol invasions into Islamic lands began in the early 1200s and culminated in the 1258 sack of Baghdad. Eventually, the Mongols established their rule as the Yuan dynasty in China, the Chagatay Khanate in Central Asia, the Golden Horde Khanate in southern Russia, and the Ilkhanid dynasty (1256–1335) in greater Iran. The integration of a vast Eurasian territory into the Mongol Empire facilitated commerce and communication, bringing fresh Chinese inspiration into Islamic art.",2018-11-06T03:57:35-0500,0,0,Fritware with molded decoration under monochrome blue glaze,176582,2003.165,,0,Seljuk-Atabeg period,6836.0,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:764514,"Ann B.

Although in the earlier Western Zhou period, bronze was employed primarily for ritual vessels, weapons, and tools, during the Eastern Zhou era, it began to be used to make mirrors, bells, and chariot fittings as well. Bronze mirrors were polished smooth on their reflective sides, and their backs were intricately decorated with auspicious symbols or cosmological designs. Their reflectivity was believed to create light in a darkened tomb and to ward off evil. Chariots were vital for military warfare, and those of the powerful were fitted with ornate finials and attachments, which during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) were often inlaid with precious stones and metals. This technique was also employed with greater frequency in the casting of bronze vessels, revealing yet another shift in the function of such objects, from commemorative status symbols to more decorative vestiges of a ritual tradition.",2018-11-06T04:02:29-0500,0,0,Cast bronze with gray-green patina,204198,1944.57.4,,0,"Zhou dynasty, Warring States period, 475-221 BCE",249.0,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC251409_dynmc,"Private Collection (by 1944), gift; to Fogg Art Museum, 1944.",4,273,0,,,,,,,'He' Ritual Wine Vessel in the Form of a Standing Duck,1,849,685,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/204198,3,Good.

Their shape tend to be assimilated to that of a bird by the addition a crop at the neck and often also eyes. Buff examples with reddish-brown painted decoration comprising geometric motifs as well as animal figures are known from ""Cemetery B"" at Tepe Sialk, near Kashan on the Iranian plateau.",am_asianmediterranean@harvard.edu,0,,"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Anonymous Gift",Iranian,-900,9th-8th century BCE,-700,2010-11-25,2018-10-30,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,"The vessel has a shallow foot with flat base. A slight edge marks the transition of shoulder to neck, which opens in a flaring mouth. A flat strap handle connects lip and shoulder. Opposite the handle is a spout terminating in a long, trough-shaped and tapering beak (the very tip appears to be missing). It is linked to the vessel’s lip by a small bridge of clay. The bird-like appearance of the vessel is reinforced by a crop on the “neck” of the spout, below the “beak.” Two raised points towards the rear of the vessel, one on each side of the handle, were perhaps inspired by bird anatomy or by the bosses covering rivets on metal vessels of similar shape.

The body of the vessel is fired buff to light reddish brown. Its surface is polished and painted with dark reddish-brown decoration. The most elaborate patterns occur at the transition to the spout, where a row of elongated triangles is reminiscent of a bird’s breast feathers. Other motifs include checkerboard and crosshatching. A large diamond filled with checkerboard decorates each side of the vessel, elongated triangles run along the beak-shaped spout, and wavy bands encircle the vessel’s mouth. The handle bears zigzag decoration with interspersed dots, the handle base is framed by volutes, and there is a diamond filled with dotted crosshatching below. On the vessel's interior, the lip is lined with dots, which also appear on the exterior at the transition from shoulder to neck and above the foot. The unpolished underside of the foot shows a sloppily painted cross with a dot in each quadrant, as well as smudged paint.

The vessel’s mouth and spout are reassembled from a number of fragments; some 40% of the lip are restored. The painted decoration is abraded where the vessel’s circumference is the largest.

Hoppin",Greek,-425,420-400 BCE,-395,2010-01-24,2018-11-05,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,"The scene on the front of the pelike (jar) comprises five figures: a couple consisting of a woman and a young man, flanked by a boy and second woman, respectively. A small Eros flutters in between. The central woman holds a lobed shallow bowl--likely meant to be of precious metal--in her proper left hand and lifts the upper edge of her finely pleated garment with her right. She faces a young man seated on a rocky outcrop, which is indicated by fine lines incised into the black background. He sits in a relaxed pose, with crossed legs, his right hand placed on his knee, and holding two long spears in his left. His richly patterned clothing consists of a cap with long flaps and a body suit with zigzag patterns below a sleeveless garment richly decorated with elongated triangles, volutes, diamonds, and a wreath motif. Reminiscent of the clothing worn by Greece’s eastern neighbors, this highly ornate, “foreign” costume was used by Greek vase painters to characterize barbarians. Here it probably denotes a mythical easterner: Paris, prince of Troy (Adonis has been proposed, as well).

Paris’ gaze is focused on the woman before him, likely the beautiful Helen, while he is crowned by Eros flying above. The woman behind Paris holds another, now barely visible garland up to his head. She could be the goddess Aphrodite or her companion Peitho (“persuasion”). She stands firmly on the ground line, as does the boy on the other side of the composition. He, too, is characterized by his rich eastern dress with zigzag and leaf patterns and wears a floppy cap with long flaps. With his left he extends a drinking horn, whose striped pattern was probably intended to denote its material as gold or silver, another barbarian attribute and a reference to the wealth of the royal house of Troy.

The simpler scene on the pelike’s back features three women: a central woman holding a box and two fringed, patterned sashes or towels, a woman fully wrapped in a large mantle with a thick, black border (on the left), and another woman with mantle holding what appears to be a garland (on the right). The figures are more cursorily drawn than those on the front. Double palmettes decorate the lower handle attachment.

Most of the finer lines are slightly raised, and raised dots decorate belts and borders of the elaborate garments. Diluted glaze was used for selected ornaments and the soft folds of the caps. Faint traces of added paint remain for the garlands held by Eros and the woman standing behind Paris. On the back, added paint was used to render the hairbands of all three women, the fringes of the sashes held by the central woman, and the garland held by the woman on the right. Pre-drawings are visible on all figures painted on the vessel’s front. The vessel is complete but has some minor surface erosion and manganese staining.
