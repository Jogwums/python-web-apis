# Python Web API Workshop Materials

This repository contains example code to use in learning to work with RESTful
web APIs in Python. The main notebook file is called `Geonames.ipynb`, and uses
the `botanical_gardens.csv` data file.

You can download the repository either with
`git clone https://github.com/artshumrc/python-web-apis.git` from the terminal,
or by clicking the green button towards the top right that says "Clone or
download" and clicking "Download ZIP".

The code uses Python 3.6 with the `requests` and `pandas` modules.
